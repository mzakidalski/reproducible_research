```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## The synopsis

This analysis is going to answer the following two questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

The data used in this analysis comes from the following source: <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2>.

## Data Processing

R packages used in the analysis:

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```

From the data set we are interested only in the following columns:

* STATE - code abbreviating the state
* BGN_DATE, END_DATE - event start/end dates
* PROPDMG / CROPDMG - describes the damage to the property/crop
* PROPDMGEXP / CROPDMGEXP - multipliers to the previous values (k/K for 1000, m/M for 1 000 000, b/B for 1 000 000 000)                  .                                
Data loading (we assume that the download dataset is present in the working folder):
```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

all_weather_data <- read_csv("repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2")
filtered_cols_data <- all_weather_data %>% select(STATE, BGN_DATE, END_DATE, 
                                                  PROPDMG, PROPDMGEXP, CROPDMG, 
                                                  CROPDMGEXP, INJURIES, FATALITIES)
```









## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
